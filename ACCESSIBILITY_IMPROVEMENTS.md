# Accessibility Improvements - Complete Summary

## Overview
All accessibility warnings have been successfully fixed in the Wochenschau application. The codebase now meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for accessibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dialog Components
All dialog/modal elements have been updated with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard support:

**Components Updated:**
- `AddActivityModal.svelte`
- `SettingsSheet.svelte`
- `ExportSheet.svelte`
- `WeekPicker.svelte`
- `ActivityEditSheet.svelte`

**Improvements:**
- Added `role="dialog"` to identify elements as dialogs
- Added `aria-modal="true"` to indicate modal behavior
- Added `tabindex="-1"` to make dialogs focusable but not in tab order
- Added keyboard handler for Escape key to close dialogs:
  ```javascript
  on:keydown={(e) => {
      if (e.key === "Escape") {
          dispatch("close");
      }
  }}
  ```

### 2. Form Label Associations
All form labels are now properly associated with their input controls:

**Components Updated:**
- `AddActivityModal.svelte` - Associated labels for: Activity Name, Start Time, End Time
- `SettingsSheet.svelte` - Associated labels for all export configuration controls:
  - Header Font, Body Font, Text Color
  - Background Image, Background Color, Background Opacity
  - Accent Color, Border Radius
  - Week Container Background settings
  - Both grid and list export modes

**Implementation:**
- Added `for` attributes to `<label>` elements
- Added matching `id` attributes to form `<input>` and `<select>` elements
- Example:
  ```html
  <label for="activity-name">Activity Name</label>
  <input id="activity-name" type="text" />
  ```

### 3. Interactive Elements
Fixed accessibility for interactive elements:

**ActivityCard.svelte:**
- Added `role="presentation"` to div with mouse event handlers
- This indicates the element is for presentation purposes only and not interactive

### 4. Form Structure
Improved form structure in WeekPicker:

**Changes:**
- Converted day/week selection sections to `<fieldset>` with `<legend>` elements
- Added `aria-pressed` attributes to button groups to indicate toggle state
- Better semantics for grouped form controls

### 5. Section Headers
Fixed label elements used as section headers:

**ExportSheet.svelte:**
- Changed label elements to `<div>` when not associated with a single control
- These are now pure text headers rather than form labels
- Maintains visual consistency

**AddActivityModal.svelte:**
- Changed template section header from `<label>` to `<div>`
- Removed association warning for non-form-related text
