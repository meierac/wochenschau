# Export Layout Improvements

## Overview
The export preview layout (both grid and list views) has been optimized to display with a **fixed width of 800px** while maintaining **responsive height** based on content. This ensures consistent, professional-looking exports regardless of the user's screen size.

## Changes Made

### Fixed Width Container
- **Width**: 800px (fixed, centered)
- **Purpose**: Provides a consistent, readable layout that's wide enough to display all data clearly without being dependent on screen size
- **Implementation**: Applied inline style `width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;` to the `#export-preview` container

### Responsive Height
- **Previous**: `max-h-96` (fixed maximum height of 384px) with `overflow-auto`
- **New**: `max-h-[60vh]` (60% of viewport height) with `overflow-auto`
- **Benefit**: Height adjusts based on content while still maintaining scrollability for very long agendas
- **User Experience**: Preview shows more content naturally without forcing scroll in most cases

## Layout Modes

### Grid View (4-column layout)
- Each day gets its own column
- Activities are displayed in cards with:
  - Day name and date
  - Activity list with color-coded left border
  - Time information (start - end)
- Fixed width ensures all 4 columns fit perfectly without cramping

### List View (vertical layout)
- Days are displayed sequentially with colored left border
- Activities are shown below each day
- Fixed width provides adequate space for activity details
- Better readability with consistent text width

## Benefits

1. **Screen Size Independence**: Layout looks the same on mobile, tablet, or desktop
2. **Professional Export Quality**: Consistent width ensures polished JPG/image exports
3. **Content-Driven Height**: No wasted space; height adapts to actual content
4. **Improved Readability**: 800px width is optimal for reading activity information
5. **Better Scrolling**: When content exceeds 60vh, users can scroll within the preview

## Technical Details

### Container Structure
```
Preview Container (overflow-auto, max-h-[60vh])
└── Export Preview (#export-preview, width: 800px, centered)
    ├── Header (centered title & date range)
    └── Content (grid or list based on layoutMode)
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
- The outer dialog remains responsive to screen size
- The inner content maintains fixed 800px width
- Suitable for both desktop and mobile viewing

## Export Quality Impact

When exporting to JPG:
- Image width corresponds to the 800px preview width
- Image height automatically adjusts based on content length
- No unnecessary white space or cramped layouts
- Consistent aspect ratio across different weeks/agenda sizes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Width customization option in settings (e.g., 600px, 800px, 1000px)
- Print-optimized layout with page breaks
- Landscape vs portrait export options
- Custom header/footer text for exports
